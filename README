This homebrew application is used to install the secondary homebrew exploit for
Monster Hunter Generations.

To install the exploit, download the latest version from the release page,
extract it to the root of your SD card and run it from the Homebrew Launcher.

***Also, when a new system version is released, you need to re-run the
installer BEFORE doing the system update and select the NEW system version when
asked.***

To run the exploit just go to the offline Hunters Hub and try posting an event
quest or challenge quest, depending on which you selected when installing.

To uninstall the exploit, select the "Download" option in the game's main menu
and re-download the first challenge or event quest (depending on which you
selected while installing). Keep this in mind when using the "Download" option
normally so that you don't accidentally uninstall the exploit.

There are some notable limitations for this exploit:
  * It only works on New 3DS systems. This is because game uses extended memory
    mode on Old 3DS systems.
  * It must be installed on the system you want to use it on. This is because
    the exploit uses the game's ExtData which is stored on the SD card, not the
    game cart.
  * You will no longer be able to post certain quests in the Hunters Hub. If
    you install the exploit as an event quest, you wont be able to post event
    quests. If you install the exploit as a challenge quest, you wont be able to
    post challenge quests. But you should still be able to join event/challenge
    quests that other players post.
